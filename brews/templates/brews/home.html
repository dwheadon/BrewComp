<h1>Welcome to BrewComp</h1>
<p>
    Comparisons are hard and using scales that require finer distinctions than 
    we can reliably make (such as the 20 point scale for flavor on the BJCP 
    scorecard) introduces subjectivity and is much more prone to error 
    (<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/What_We_Know_About_Grading.html?id=hRaIDwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description">Guskey, Thomas R. "Chapter 1" <i>What We Know about Grading</i>, 2019</a>). 
    BrewComp attempts to
    eliminate these problems by making the levels of comparison smaller by 
    breaking a large number of entries into size-limited heats and reducing the 
    scale to a simple ranking (best to worst). The hope is that this will 
    produce a much more accurate determination of the relative ranking of 
    the brews but could also be mapped back to the more traditional scale used by the 
    BJCP to give a more absolute determination of how the brews would have 
    scored.

    BrewComp was designed and implemented by Dan Wheadon for the competitions
    held by the 
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ChicagoHomeBrewersGroup/">
        Chicago Home Brewer's (Facebook) Group
    </a>. If successful, it could be made available to others who would like to 
    use it for their own local competitions.
    Imlemented using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, the source code can be found on
